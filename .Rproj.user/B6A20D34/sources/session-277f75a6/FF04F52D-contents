# 1. Motivation

The tree point shot is one the most interesting phenomena in sporting history. 
When playing basketball, if a shot is made from within the three point line,
it counts as 2 points, however, baskets made from beyond the line are worth
three. Its earliest introduction to a professional basketball league was in 
1961, when the American Basketball League deemed that shots made from a distance 
of 25 feet and greater were to be counted as three
points [[1](https://www.usab.com/news/2014/01/history-of-the-3-pointer)]. The 
distance of the three point line from the net has varied over time, and still 
varies across different leagues. The official NBA three point line is 23 feet 
and 9 inches from the center of the 
basket [[2](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-1-court-dimensions-equipment/)], 
where as in the NCAA and WNBA, the line is only 22 feet and 1.75 inches from the 
basket's center [[3](https://www.wnba.com/wnba-rule-book), [4](https://www.ncaapublications.com/p-4657-2022-2023-ncaa-division-i-manual.aspx)].

However, its not only the three point line itself that has evolved, but the way
it influences the game. What was once considered a desperation play, the three
pointer has now become a quintessential part of a team's preparation. There are 
now teams whose coaches build teams around elite three point shooters, and are 
willing to pay these players tens of millions of dollars each year   [[5](https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/six-players-re-signing-20170725)]. In 
1979-80, an average of 2.8 shots per game were taken from beyond the line, 
whereas in the 2022-23 NBA season, an average of 32.4 attempts were taken every game [[6](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html)].

With three point shooting becoming such a prevalent part of the NBA, fans and 
commentators have taken notice. Some have even gone as far as to say three point 
shooting has ruined the game, but do these claims have any weight? With this
analysis, I aim to explore the evolution of three point shooting over the years,
and examine how effective three point shooting really is.

# 2. Background

For my analysis, I'll be using a combination of NBA shot log data pulled from
the NBA Stat API (now discontinued), which contains spatial data for all shots
taken in the NBA from 1997 to 2020, the [NBA Database data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball) (found on Kaggle), 
which contains record off all NBA games played 
since the 1946-47 NBA season, and the [NBA Stats data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats?select=Player+Totals.csv)
which was scraped from [Stathead](https://stathead.com/), and contains seasonal
information regarding the stats of all NBA players since 1947.

# 3. Methods

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(jpeg)
library(patchwork)
```

## 3.1 Data Import and Cleaning

The first data set we're going to import is the one keeping track of game
data. Very little needs to be done in terms of preparing the data set, we 
specify that the id columns ought to be parsed as integers (as opposed to 
doubles), and in place of the "W"s and "L"s used to denoted wins and losses
respectively in the win loss column, we'll parse them as logical TRUE and FALSE
values instead.

```{r}
game_data <- read_csv(
  "data/game.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    season_id = col_integer(),
    team_id_home = col_integer(),
    team_id_away = col_integer(),
    game_id = col_integer(),
  )
)

game_data <- game_data %>%
  mutate(home_win = ifelse(wl_home == "W", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(away_win = ifelse(wl_away == "W", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(video_available_home = ifelse(video_available_home == 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  mutate(video_available_away = ifelse(video_available_away == 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  select(-c(wl_home, wl_away))

game_data
```

Next, we'll perform some manipulations to transform our game data set into
a summary of seasonal team statistics. Firstly, note that for each game, there
are two team's statistics we have to record, the home teams' stats, and the away
team's stats. We'll start by creating two data frames, one that groups all games
by home team, by year and another that groups all games by away team, by year. 
We can sum each group's numeric results to get aggregated statistics on how
many shots, fouls, assists, etc, each team took by year. Using these aggregate
statistics, we can compute summary statistics such as averages, counts and 
percentages.

```{r}
# summarize each team's yearly statistics for their home and away games
team_data_home <- game_data %>%
  filter(year(game_date) >= 1986) %>%
  rename(team_id = team_id_home) %>%
  select(-contains("away"))

team_data_away <- game_data %>%
  filter(year(game_date) >= 1986) %>%
  rename(team_id = team_id_away) %>%
  select(-contains("home"))

# remove the home and away suffixes on both data sets so their rows can be bound
names(team_data_home) <- gsub("_home", "", names(team_data_home))
names(team_data_away) <- gsub("_away", "", names(team_data_away))

# function that determines the current NBA season based on year
nba_season <- function (date) {
  ifelse(
    month(date) %in% 9:12,
    year(date),
    year(date) - 1
  )
}

# bind the rows, group by team and year, and add summary statistics for each 
# season
team_data <- team_data_home %>%
  bind_rows(team_data_away) %>% 
  arrange(game_date) %>%
  group_by(team_id, season_id) %>%
  summarise(
    season = nba_season(first(game_date)),
    team_name = last(team_name), 
    team_abbreviation = last(team_abbreviation), 
    games_played = n(),
    feild_goals_made = sum(fgm),
    feild_goals_attempted = sum(fga),
    three_pointers_made = sum(fg3m),
    three_pointers_attempted = sum(fg3a),
    two_pointers_attempted = feild_goals_attempted - three_pointers_attempted,
    two_pointers_made = feild_goals_made - three_pointers_made,
    free_throws_made = sum(ftm),
    free_throws_attempted = sum(fta),
    offensive_rebounds = sum(oreb),
    deffensive_rebounds = sum(dreb),
    rebounds = sum(dreb),
    assits = sum(ast),
    steals = sum(stl),
    blocks = sum(blk),
    turnovers = sum(tov),
    fouls = sum(pf),
    points = sum(pts),
    plus_minus = sum(plus_minus)
  )  %>%
  mutate(
    across(-c("team_name", "team_abbreviation", "games_played"), 
           (function (x) x / games_played), 
           .names = "avg_{.col}_per_game"),
    feild_goal_percentage = feild_goals_made / feild_goals_attempted,
    two_point_percentage = two_pointers_made / two_pointers_attempted,
    three_point_percentage = three_pointers_made / three_pointers_attempted,
    free_throw_percentage = free_throws_made / free_throws_attempted,
  )

team_data
```

By grouping the team data by year, we can also generate a data frame for
league wide seasonal data.

```{r}
league_data <- team_data %>% 
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(across(-c("team_name", "team_abbreviation"), sum)) %>%
  mutate(
    across(
      c("feild_goals_made", 
        "feild_goals_attempted", 
        "two_pointers_made",
        "two_pointers_attempted",
        "three_pointers_made",
        "three_pointers_attempted",
        "free_throws_made",
        "free_throws_attempted",
        "points"
        ), 
      (function(x) x / games_played),
      .names = "avg_{.col}_per_game"
    ),
    feild_goal_percentage = feild_goals_made / feild_goals_attempted,
    two_point_percentage = two_pointers_made / two_pointers_attempted,
    three_point_percentage = three_pointers_made / three_pointers_attempted,
    free_throw_percentage = free_throws_made / free_throws_attempted,
  )
```

Finally, we'll import the player data. The only cleaning that needs to be done
is the renaming of columns into a human readable format.

```{r}
player_stats <- read_csv("./data/player_stats.csv")

player_stats <- player_stats %>%
  rename(
    position = pos,
    league = lg,
    team_name = tm,
    games = g,
    games_started = gs,
    minuptes_played = mp,
    feild_goals = fg,
    feild_goals_attempted = fga,
    feild_goal_percentage = fg_percent,
    three_pointers_made = x3p,
    three_pointers_attempted = x3pa,
    three_point_percentage = x3p_percent,
    two_pointers_made = x2p,
    two_pointers_attempted = x2pa,
    two_point_percentage = x2p_percent,
    effective_feild_goal_percentage = e_fg_percent,
    free_throws_made = ft,
    free_throws_attempted = fta,
    offensive_rebounds = orb,
    defensive_rebounds = drb,
    total_rebounds = trb,
    assists = ast,
    steals = stl,
    blocks = blk,
    turnovers = tov,
    personal_fouls = pf,
    points = pts
    )
```

```{r}
spatial_data <- read_csv("./data/NBA_shot_log_1997_2020.csv")
colnames(spatial_data) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(spatial_data))
```

## 3.2 Exploring the Prevelance of Three Point Shooting Over Time

The first step in our analysis will consist exploring how common the three point
shot really is. We explore time series data, as well as the distribution of 
three point shooting across the league and different players. While we can't
draw any causal conclusions from our analysis, we hope to provide insight into
how the three point shot has evolved over time, possible explanations as to why
it has become so prevalent in modern basketball, and points of interest in the 
history of the three point shot.

### 3.2.1 Increase in Three Point Shooting Over the Years

First, let's examine the average number of three pointers taken per game.

```{r}
league_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = three_pointers_attempted / games_played)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
img <- readJPEG("./data/nba_court.jpg", native = TRUE)

graph <- spatial_data %>%
  filter(Game_ID == 0029700427) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = X_Location, y = Y_Location)) +
  geom_point()

img_graph <- graph +                  
  inset_element(p = img,
                left = 250,
                bottom = -52,
                right = -250,
                top = 418)

img_graph
```


### 3.2.2 Reducing The Three Point Range

The plot below is a time series graph that depicts how the ratio of three 
pointers to two pointers has evolved over the seasons.

```{r}
league_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = three_pointers_attempted / two_pointers_attempted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(color = "Implemented"), 
             fill = "black", 
             shape = 21, 
             stroke = 2, 
             data = filter(league_data, season == 1994)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "Retracted"), 
             fill = "black", 
             shape = 21, 
             stroke = 2, 
             data = filter(league_data, season == 1997)) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Three Point Range Reduction",
                       breaks = c("Implemented", "Retracted"),
                       values = c("Implemented" = "red", "Retracted" = "blue")) +
  xlab("Season") +
  ylab("Three Pointer to Two Pointer Ratio") +
  ggtitle("Three to Two Point Attempt Ratio Over the Seasons") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

There's clearly been a steady increase in three point shooting over the history
of the NBA, however, there are some points of interest in the graph above.

Firstly, note the large jump in the three to two pointer ratio between the 1993 
and 1994 season, it went from 0.13 to 0.23. After some investigation, it turns 
out that in 1994, the NBA implemented an interesting rule change. If we create 
plot of the league's average points per game, we can see that preceding 1994, 
the average number of points per game had been declining steadily year over 
year. 

```{r}
league_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = points / games_played)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(league_data, season < 1994), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(league_data, 1994 <= season & season <= 1996), method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(data = filter(league_data, 1994 <= season & season <= 1996), mapping = aes(color = "Seasons with 22 ft three point line")) +
  ylab("Average Points Per Game") +
  xlab("Season") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "",
                     breaks = c("Seasons with 22 ft three point line"),
                     values = c("red")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  ggtitle("Average Points Per Game Over The Seasons")
```

During the 1994 season, the NBA implemented a rule change that would reduce the 
distance of the three point point line from 23 feet and 9 inches, down to an 
even 22 feet. This was their attempt to increase the amount of scoring that
happened per game. While the policy did increase the rate at which teams shot 
three pointers, as shown in *Fig 1*, the average number of points per game 
continued to decline. In fact, if we fit a linear regression to the points prior
to the policy change, and another one while the policy change was in place, we
see that the average points per game were declining even faster than they had 
been without the rule change (*Fig 2*).



```{r}
lm(points / games_played ~ season, filter(league_data, season < 1994))
```

```{r}
lm(points / games_played ~ season, filter(league_data, 1994 <= season & season <= 1996))
```

$$
Y_{\text{Pre Policy}} = 1967.0862  -0.9353X \\
Y_{\text{During Policy}} = 4591.442  -2.252X 
$$

While the intercept is rather meaningless, these regressions tell us that prior
to the policy change, the average number of points per game was falling at a 
rate of about 0.94 points per season, where as after the during the period in 
which the policy was active, it was falling at a rate of 2.25 points per season.

After three years, the league reverted their decision, which coincides with a 
sudden drop in three point shooting in 1997.

### 3.2.3 Rise in the Growth Rate of Three Point Shooting

Turning our attention back to *Fig 1*, there is another noteworthy feature. 
After 2012, the rate at which three point shoots have been growing year over 
year explodes. This is made clear when we plot a time series showing the change 
in the three to two pointer ratio.

```{r}
league_data %>%
  mutate(delta_tpr = three_pointers_attempted / two_pointers_attempted - 
           lag(three_pointers_attempted) / lag(two_pointers_attempted)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, delta_tpr)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

```{r}
team_data %>%
  filter(season == 2011 | season == 2012) %>%
  ggplot(aes(three_pointers_attempted / two_pointers_attempted - lag(three_pointers_attempted / two_pointers_attempted))) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ season, nrow=2)
```
